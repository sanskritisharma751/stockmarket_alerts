# When STOCK price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and
# the day before yesterday then print("Get News").
#HINT 1: Get the closing price for yesterday and
# the day before yesterday. Find the positive difference between the two prices.
# e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20.
#HINT 2: Work out the value of 5% of yerstday's closing stock price.

# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually fetch the first 3 articles for the COMPANY_NAME.
